        // TODO 1: Declare a named constant for quarts per gallon
         final int QUARTS_PER_GALLON = 4;

        // TODO 2: Declare quartsNeeded and assign 18

        // TODO 3: Compute gallons and leftover quarts using / and %
        int gallons = quartsNeeded / QUARTS_PER_GALLON;     // This is used to get the number of complete gallons
        int quarts = quartsNeeded % QUARTS_PER_GALLON;      // This is used to get the reminder of what cannot be completed as a gallon.

        // TODO 4: Display EXACT format:
        // A job that needs 18 quarts requires 4 gallons plus 2 quarts.
        System.out.println("A job that needs " + quartsNeeded + " quarts requires "
                + gallons + " gallons plus " + quarts + " quarts.");
